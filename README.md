Trajectory prediction has been widely pursued in many fields, and many model-based and model-free methods have been explored. The former include rule-based, geometric or optimization-based models, and the latter are mainly comprised of deep learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a new method combining both methodologies based on a new Neural Differential Equation model. Our new model (Neural Social Physics or NSP) is a deep neural network within which we use an explicit physics model with learnable parameters. The explicit physics model serves as a strong inductive bias in modeling pedestrian behaviors, while the rest of the network provides a strong data-fitting capability in terms of system parameter estimation and dynamics stochasticity modeling. We compare NSP with 15 recent deep learning methods on 6 datasets and improve the state-of-the-art performance by 5.56%-70%. Besides, we show that NSP has better generalizability in predicting plausible trajectories in drastically different scenarios where the density is 2-5 times as high as the testing data. Finally, we show that the physics model in NSP can provide plausible explanations for pedestrian behaviors, as opposed to black-box deep learning.

## Get Started
### Dependencies
Below is the key environment under which the code was developed, not necessarily the minimal requirements:  
  
 1 Python 3.8.8  
 2 pytorch 1.9.1  
 3 Cuda 11.1  
  
And other libraries such as numpy.  
### Prepare Data  
Raw data: SDD (https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/uav_data/) and ETH/UCY (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aess/dataset/)  
Algorithms in data/SDD_ini can be used to process raw data into training data and testing data. The training/testing split is same as Y-net.  

### Training  
We employ a progressive training scheme. Run train_goals.py, train_nsp_wo.py and train_nsp_w.nsp to train Goals-Network, Collision-Network with k_env and CVAE respectively. The outputs are saved in saved_models. There are trained models in saved_models for test.  
For example  
`python train_goals.py                                                                                `
