# [Human Trajectory Prediction via Neural Social Physics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10435.pdf)

![ Trajectory prediction has been widely pursued in many fields,
and many model-based and model-free methods have been explored. The
former include rule-based, geometric or optimization-based models, and
the latter are mainly comprised of deep learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a new method combining both methodologies based on a
new Neural Differential Equation model. Our new model (Neural Social
Physics or NSP) is a deep neural network within which we use an explicit
physics model with learnable parameters. The explicit physics model
serves as a strong inductive bias in modeling pedestrian behaviors, while
the rest of the network provides a strong data-fitting capability in terms
of system parameter estimation and dynamics stochasticity modeling. We
compare NSP with 15 recent deep learning methods on 6 datasets and improve the state-of-the-art performance by 5.56%-70%. Besides, we show
that NSP has better generalizability in predicting plausible trajectories in
drastically different scenarios where the density is 2-5 times as high as the
testing data. Finally, we show that the physics model in NSP can provide
plausible explanations for pedestrian behaviors, as opposed to black-box
